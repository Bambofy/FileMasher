Just a quick crappy script for anyone who wants to mash all their files into one...
Just run this is terminal/cmd "python filemasher.py" and follow the on screen instructions!

This is by no means a perfect script, i hardly ever use python, so if anyone can improve it PLEASE show me because i'd love to use it.
